# Problem

When using the video tag, video previews don’t display on mobile devices (specifically mobile Chrome and Safari), even though they work perfectly on desktop browsers.

On iPhone:

<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/video-preview-on-mobile/mobile.jpeg" className="shadow-xl" height={200} width={200} />
</div>

On laptop:

<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/video-preview-on-mobile/desktop.png" className="shadow-md" height={900} width={900} />
</div>

The video tag is as follows:

```html
<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <video src="/posts/nime-w2-first-try/ableton.mov" controls autoplay playsinline preload="metadata" width={600} height={600}  />
</div>
```

# Trying

Initially, **adding the autoplay attribute** seemed to work. On mobile, due to stricter autoplay policies, the video pauses at the first frame, providing a sort of preview. This behavior also occurs on desktop, where Chrome’s autoplay policy pauses videos at the first frame.

However, on desktop devices, as the [**Media Engagement Index (MEI)**](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay#media_engagement_index) increases, videos may start autoplaying unexpectedly, which leads to an inconsistent user experience. As a result, relying on autoplay is not an ideal solution.

# Solution

The solution lies in using [**Media Fragments**](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/), a specification that allows for sharing specific parts of audio and video files through URL parameters. By loading and pausing the video at the first millisecond, you can achieve a proper video preview on both mobile and desktop.

To implement this, append **#t=0.001** to the video URL:

```html
<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <video src="/posts/nime-w2-first-try/ableton.mov#t=0.001" controls autoplay playsinline preload="metadata" width={600} height={600}  />
</div>
```

This method ensures that both mobile and desktop browsers display a preview without triggering unexpected autoplay behaviors.
