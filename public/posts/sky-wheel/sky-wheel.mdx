This is a generative animation of a sky wheel, with continuously changing cables and a randomly generated background.

In this project, I focus on the colours, to make it looks better. I found a website  [https://colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co) that helped me deal with the colour problem.

I also use a sub-function to generate carriage in this work. For the math functions, I used sin(), cos(), map(). I learned especially how to use sin() and cos() to generate spinning animations, that’s quite useful.

Combining circular and linear movements, I found it is fascinating to combine different movements. 

Sin() and Cos() are very useful when generating a continuous value or circular movement, which has never been tried before. I tried to use rotate() to spin things last week, but it didn’t work. This week learned the right and efficient way to spin things.
