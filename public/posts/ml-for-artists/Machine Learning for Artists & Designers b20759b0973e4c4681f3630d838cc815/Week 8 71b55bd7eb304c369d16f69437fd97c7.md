# Week 8

> Alone or with a partner, come up with a creative application for using Stable Diffusion with p5 based on [this starter code](https://editor.p5js.org/gohai/sketches/K-3C74k7Z).
> 
> - It is possible to combine this code with the OpenAI code we used earlier. For this you would have to add the `openai.js` file to the sketch and include it in `index.html` similarly to how `localsd.js` is included.
> - If the server stops working, please let [@gohai](https://imaallclasses.slack.com/team/U02C6BFE9QR) know on Slack.

Denny and I created this creative tool for generating a 9-grid comics based on the user input using both OpenAI and Stable Diffusion API, our program basically works this way: 1. The user input one sentence of the key element or the brief of the story, and then this input will be sent into ChatGPT to generate a dialogue(which will be put onto the comics with a text box) and a description for each image. Then the description of 9 images will be sent into Stable Diffusion and we have prompted it in comic style, when the images are out they will be put into the grids with the dialogues on textbox, it looks very much like an actual comic generator. 

Here are some outputs we got with user input provided below:

1. Donald Trump’s Adventure

> Images generated with Stable Diffusion are said to share a similar type of aesthetic and similar properties/flaws… Imagine yourself as an art critic who has to give a presentation about this image-making technique: Use Stable Diffusion to create 4 images that *critique* image-making with Stable Diffusion - for example, by exaggerating some of its unique quirks. Add a sentence or to two each of the images.

1. Nestled in the heart of nature, a beautiful place unfolds before your eyes, a tranquil oasis of serenity and splendor. It's a picturesque scene that seems like it was plucked from a postcard, a destination that invokes a sense of wonder and awe.

I think this work is lack of focus. It is hard to find a object to place our sight, and the forest it depicted is a bit to messy.

1. The air is imbued with a delicate briny scent, carried by a light breeze that caresses the skin, offering a soothing relief from the sun's warm embrace. The sky, a canvas of ever-changing hues, transitions from a brilliant cerulean to soft pastel shades during sunset, casting a dreamlike glow upon the landscape.

It is good-looking, but it is too normal. It looks just like a normal picture. 

> Read Hito Steyerl’s [Mean Images](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images) (New Left Review, Mar/June 2023, online). Rephrase a part of her critique of generative AI images with your own words.
> 

She evaluates the innovative images generated by machine learning algorithms, asserting that these visuals do not represent reality but rather statistical patterns. Instead of depicting real objects, they portray typical ones. Rather than conveying absolute truth, they communicate probabilities. Instead of serving as precise representations, they operate as simulations.

She coins the term "mean images" for these visuals because of the various meanings associated with the word "mean." They are "mean" in the sense of being average, stemming from extensive online datasets. They are "mean" in terms of being of inferior quality, marked by low resolution. They are "mean" in the context of cost-effectiveness, relying on cheap and potentially exploitative data sources. Lastly, they are "mean" by reflecting societal biases and prejudices.

> Come up with two questions about anything related to week 8’s content.
> 
1. How to control more parameters of SD through API? Like resolution.
2. Is there any way to control the style of SD, and let the pics it generated be consistent in style?
