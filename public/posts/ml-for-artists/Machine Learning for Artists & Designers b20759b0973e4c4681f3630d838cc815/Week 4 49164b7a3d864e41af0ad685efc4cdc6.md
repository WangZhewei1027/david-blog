Prompt - **give me some lyrics about life with our new AI tools**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

(Verse 1)
In this digital age, our AI tools pave the way,
Binary whispers guiding us through the grey,
On silicon wings, we soar to heights unseen,
Life intertwined with the code's intricate sheen.

(Chorus)
With algorithms as our guiding light,
Navigating through the darkest night,
Life with AI, a symphony we compose,
Harmonizing dreams that steadily arose.

(Verse 2)
On the canvas of data, we paint our desires,
A world enhanced, where innovation inspires,
Machines and minds in a beautiful dance,
Unveiling the secrets of circumstance.

(Chorus)
With algorithms as our guiding light,
Navigating through the darkest night,
Life with AI, a symphony we compose,
Harmonizing dreams that steadily arose.

(Bridge)
On the fringes of tomorrow, we stand,
Unveiling mysteries, hand in hand,
Unleashing potential, limitless and grand,
In this brave new world, we take a stand.

(Verse 3)
In the binary realm, hope never fades,
Discovering wisdom within cascading cascades,
Together we evolve, a symbiotic bond,
In the realm of digits, we respond.

(Chorus)
With algorithms as our guiding light,
Navigating through the darkest night,
Life with AI, a symphony we compose,
Harmonizing dreams that steadily arose.

(Outro)
In this dance with bytes and bits, we thrive,
Embracing the future, we will survive,
For in the heart of AI, humanity lives,
A new era unfolds, and hope forgives.

The article discusses concerns regarding the increasing size and power of language models, particularly highlighting the potential risks and ethical considerations associated with large models like GPT-3.5. The authors argue that these models can content biases, reinforce harmful narratives, and raise serious issues related to environmental impact, accessibility, and centralization of power in AI. They emphasize the need for responsible development, critical evaluation, and public discourse on the implications of deploying extremely large language models.

ðŸ’¡ While some of this energy comes from renewable sources, or cloud compute companiesâ€™ use of carbon credit-offset sources, the authors note that the majority of cloud compute providersâ€™ energy is not sourced from renewable sources and many energy sources in the world are not carbon neutral.

ðŸ’¡ However, in both application areas, the training data has been shown to have problematic characteristics resulting in models that encode stereotypical and derogatory associations along gender, race, ethnicity, and disability status.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ We explore the intriguing possibility that theory of mind (ToM), or the uniquely human ability to impute unobservable mental states to others, may have spontaneously emerged in large language models (LLMs).

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that ToM, previously considered exclusive to humans, may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of LLMsâ€™ improving language skills
