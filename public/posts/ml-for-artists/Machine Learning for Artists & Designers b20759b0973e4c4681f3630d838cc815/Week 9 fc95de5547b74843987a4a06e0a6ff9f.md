# Week 9

> *Alone or with a partner, explore the creative application of img2img techniques in Stable Diffusion together with p5 based on [these starter codes](https://www.notion.so/a327765acf9d4d7f8472efb1db3cac4f?pvs=21). (Note: the result of this doesn’t need to be interactive - it could e.g. also be a static animated GIF created using code!)*

I used the img2img template to create some gif, changing Mona Lisa's classical painting.

Here are some interesting results I got:

- Prompt: Change the background

- Prompt: Change the facial expression

- Prompt: Change the style

I don’t know why the prompts didn’t make a big difference. Maybe other parameters also need to change to get a better effect.

I remember there is a film about Van Gogh [https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1862449433/?playlistId=tt3262342&ref_=tt_ov_vi](https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1862449433/?playlistId=tt3262342&ref_=tt_ov_vi) **Loving Vincent (2017)**

Every frame of the film is painted by humans, imitating Vincent’s style. It took years for the artist to paint this film out. Nowadays, if we use AI tech, this film can be generated in hours. Artists can just draw a sketch of each scene, and just throw them to the machine, which is quite scary how powerful the AI is.
