# Course Reflection

In this course, I mainly learned about the innovative use of AI. The exploration of AI as a tool for enhancement rather than autonomous creation is a key takeaway. Understanding the technical aspects of machine learning and AI, particularly in the context of your projects, allowed me to witness the tangible results and the limitless creative potential that arises when combining JavaScript with OpenAI and Stable Diffusion.

In the process of preparing for the IMA show, I also learned something about how to prepare an art exhibition. Also while introducing my project to the audience, I also gained more inspiration from the audience and learned how to present my idea in a proper way. 

In a nutshell, this course has not only expanded my comprehension of machine learning and OpenAI but has also empowered me with the skills to navigate and contribute meaningfully to AI and creativity. It also inspired me to continue to learn meaning in my CS major study.
