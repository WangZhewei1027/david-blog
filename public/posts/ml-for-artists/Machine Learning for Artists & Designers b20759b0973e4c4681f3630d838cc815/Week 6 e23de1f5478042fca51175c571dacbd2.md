# Week 6

> Together with the group you worked with, finish the negotiating game sketch you started in class, turning it into an polished interactive experience. (I thought the way Jiapei [embedded](https://editor.p5js.org/clarayao/sketches/ri0Q57kdY) UI elements and graphics was quite successful. You could also consider using sound or simple animation.)
> 

This is [the link](https://editor.p5js.org/Denny_Wang/sketches/FhISts_qW) to the sketch Denny and I worked on together, we worked on a lot of visual elements this time referencing [this website](https://codepen.io/sajadhsm/pen/odaBdd)

- Document some of the most funny, deep, meaningful or surprising dialog snippets that you encountered playing this game.

Whatever I say, it just won’t compromise and the structure of its reply is basically the same, Julie will show empathy first and then she will reject me.
    

> Watch the trailer for [Papers, Please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QP5X6fcukM), an award-winning indie puzzle game by Lucas Pope (no LLMs or AI involved!) some people called a “dystopian political sim”. (We didn’t get to watch this in class - wanted to share such scenario as an example for where LLMs could be considered in more darker, critical contexts.)

Maybe if AI controls the key position in society, like policy decisions, the world may become quite dystopian. The starting point of AI may be good, but the results might be bad. Like if we told the AI the job of AI under any circumstances is to respect human life and always save human lives. Then AI might keep all the cancer people alive, using every method, even if patients are very painful and don’t to be alive. We may be plugged into all kinds of pipes and don’t even have the ability to end ourselves, cuz this will against the principle of AIs. 

> Come up with 3 questions about anything relating to week 6’s content?
> 

1. What is the strength the shortcomings of regular expression? Is it suitable for any situation? What if the text is too complex to match?
2. How to adjust the difficulty of the negotiation game effectively? The way to change the prompt does not work so well. Are there any parameters directly related to the difficulty of the game?
3. How does the “requestOAI” function work? It seems callback the “gotResults” function, but suspends when waiting for the result. How does this function exactly works?

> Assemble a dataset that you want to use to fine-tune an LLM with. This could take one of the following forms:
> 
> - (Most straight-forward) A list of URLs of YouTube Videos. (Next week I’ll show how to download the audio from YouTube and use an AI model to transcribe each of the videos to extract the text.)
> - (Medium straight-forward) Put together a text file (no formatting) of text to train from. Should be at least 3000+ lines of text.
> - (Least straight-forward) Put together a list of question-response pairs you want to train from. (e.g. “What is your favorite food?” ⇒ “Japanese”) Best in JSON-format - e.g. `[{"prompt": "...", "completion": "..."}, ...]`. Should be at least 3000 pairs.

Found an interesting dataset. But not so sure how to use it for now. 

> Share some notes about what could make this dataset interesting or meaningful. What do you hope the fine-tuned model will be able to produce with it?
> 

I think this dataset reflects real-world scenarios and challenges to make it relevant for a broad range of applications. It also includes data related to current events, which is very important for a helpful application.
