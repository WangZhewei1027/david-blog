# Reflection

Reflecting on the current state of the program design, it's apparent that the architecture lacks the necessary elegance and coherence to support seamless future development. The structure as it stands presents potential obstacles for integrating new features or scaling up, which can lead to increased complexity and the potential for technical debt. To avoid such issues, it would be prudent to adopt a more deliberate and methodical approach to program design.

In future projects, I plan to invest time upfront in the planning phase to outline the functions and the overall structure. This would involve defining clear interfaces for components, ensuring modularity, and establishing a robust foundation that accommodates change and expansion. Employing design patterns where appropriate could also aid in creating a more flexible and maintainable codebase.
