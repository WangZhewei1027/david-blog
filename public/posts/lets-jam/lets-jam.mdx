A collaborative, real‑time web platform where a host can perform live and an audience can interact musically through their phones—no downloads required.

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

> **Let’s Jam** transforms any browser into a collaborative music studio. Performers stream live audio and sequences via Tone.js, while audience members use their phones to trigger beats, harmonies, or effects in real time. Whether you’re hosting an online jam session, teaching a class, or just hanging out with friends, Let’s Jam delivers low‑latency, synchronized music interaction—all powered by WebSockets and modern web technologies.
