## Elevator Pitch

This is a music generator based on real physics effects. Users can drag circles and squares, adjust their positions wherever they want, and create their music.

## Abstract

Music has been an integral part of human civilization for centuries, evolving from traditional instruments to modern software tools. While contemporary music software like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, or GarageBand has made music creation accessible to many, it often leads to compositions that sound similar due to shared samples and virtual instruments. This project aims to explore a new way to create music, enabling users to craft unique and distinctive pieces.

## Design and Composition

The initial prototype was straightforward, incorporating basic physics rules to govern interactions. As development progressed, it became evident that providing users with examples would enhance their experience. Consequently, three examples were designed to guide users in exploring the tool.

## Technical

By the project's conclusion, the accumulation of numerous HTML and JavaScript files posed organizational challenges. Future improvements include adopting a consistent naming convention from the outset to maintain code clarity. Additionally, simplifying the physics algorithms can achieve realistic bouncing effects without strictly adhering to complex physics rules.

## Reflection and Future Developments

The project introduces an original and engaging approach to music creation. However, there is room for improvement in interface aesthetics, particularly in enhancing proficiency with HTML and CSS. Interaction features can be expanded by adding more tones and making elements like the small balls clickable, allowing users to adjust the tempo and enrich the overall experience.
