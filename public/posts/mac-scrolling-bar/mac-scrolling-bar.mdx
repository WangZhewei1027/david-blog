## Issue

While working on a frontend project, I encountered an issue where the scroll bar on Mac appeared abnormal. Instead of the default style, it would randomly display an incorrect version, which was frustrating.

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/mac-scrolling-bar/normal.jpeg" className="shadow-lg" height={200} width={200} />
    <p className="text-center italic">Beautiful Normal Scrolling Bar</p>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/mac-scrolling-bar/abnormal.jpeg" className="shadow-lg" height={200} width={200} />
    <p className="text-center italic">Ugly Abnormal Scrolling Bar</p>
</div>

This issue is particularly disruptive when working with dark-themed websites. The abnormal scroll bar becomes highly noticeable and can ruin the overall design aesthetic.

## Solution

After observing the pattern, I noticed that this issue occurred across various browsers and Electron applications, suggesting it was a system-level problem. Upon further investigation, I discovered the issue stemmed from a compatibility problem in macOS settings. Specifically, the default scroll bar setting in macOS has issues when using third-party Bluetooth mice (other than the Magic Mouse). The scroll bar would appear abnormal whenever a third-party mouse was connected. This explained the inconsistency, as I don’t always use a mouse.

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/mac-scrolling-bar/default.png" className="shadow-lg" height={400} width={600} />
    <p className="text-center italic">Default Option: "Automatically based on mouse or trackpad"</p>
</div>

Changing the setting to "When Scrolling" resolved the issue entirely.

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mb-4">
    <Image src="/posts/mac-scrolling-bar/secondary_option.png" className="shadow-lg" height={400} width={600} />
    <p className="text-center italic">Show scroll bars: "When Scrolling"</p>
</div>
